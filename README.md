# 📝 ToDo App - **Cubit Playground**

## 📌 Overview

The **ToDo App** is an **educational Flutter project** focused exclusively on **Cubit-based state management**. The goal of this app is to explore different **state propagation techniques** and demonstrate their impact on architecture and code clarity.

This project compares two approaches:

✔ **Listener-based state propagation (ListenerStateShape)**
✔ **Stream subscription-based state propagation (StreamSubscriptionStateShape)**

By analyzing these techniques, the app illustrates how shifting UI-related logic to the state layer ensures **cleaner and more maintainable** code.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- ✅ **Showcase Cubit-based state propagation techniques**.
- ✅ **Compare UI-driven state updates (Listener) vs. State-driven updates (Stream Subscription)**.
- ✅ **Apply the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** to maintain strict separation between UI and business logic.
- ✅ **Demonstrate a scalable, maintainable architecture** with explicit state transitions.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Structure

The app follows a **Domain-UI structure**, eliminating unnecessary complexity while keeping logic and UI separate.

### 🌐 **Domain Layer**

- `domain/state/` – **State management cubits** (e.g., `AppSettingsCubit`, `TodoListCubit`).
- `domain/models/` – **Core data models** (`Todo`, `Filter`).
- `domain/config/` – **Global app settings and constants** (`AppConfig`, `AppStrings`).
- `domain/utils/` – **Helper functions, debounce logic, and dialogs**.

### 🎨 **UI Layer**

- `ui/pages/` – **Screens & navigation**.
- `ui/widgets/` – **Reusable UI components**.
- `ui/theme/` – **App-wide styling & theming**.

Each feature is represented by its corresponding **Cubit** inside the `domain/state/` directory, ensuring a modular and clean architecture.

## 🚀 Features & Highlights

✔ **Dynamic State Shape Switching** – Toggle between **ListenerStateShape** and **StreamSubscriptionStateShape** in real-time.
✔ **Optimized UI performance** – Uses `context.select` to minimize rebuilds.
✔ **Strict separation of concerns** – UI remains **pure**, and state logic is encapsulated in Cubits.
✔ **Hydrated State Persistence** – Ensures state is preserved across app restarts.
✔ **Dependency Injection with GetIt** – For easy service and state management.
✔ **SRP Compliance** – Business logic is fully decoupled from UI.
